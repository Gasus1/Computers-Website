    <p><strong>A computer</strong> is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of
        <i>arithmetic or logical operations (computation)</i>. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic
        sets of operations
        known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system
        may refer
        to a <em>nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral
            equipment</em> needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function
        together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

    <h3>Computer Basics</h3>

    <p>The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be
        numerically encoded, people soon realized that computers are capable of general-purpose information processing.
        Their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and accuracy of weather forecasting. Their
        speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to control
        mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear reactors, and robotic surgical tools. They are also cheap enough
        to be embedded in everyday appliances and to make clothes dryers and rice cookers “smart.” Computers have
        allowed us to pose and answer questions that could not be pursued before. These questions might be about DNA
        sequences in genes, patterns of activity in a consumer market, or all the uses of a word in texts that have been
        stored in a database. Increasingly, computers can also learn and adapt as they operate.</p>
