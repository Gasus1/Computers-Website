        <h3>Basic Information About Computers</h3>

        <p class="alignCenter"><strong>A computer</strong> is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry
            out sequences of
            <i>arithmetic or logical operations (computation)</i>. Modern digital electronic computers can perform
            generic
            sets of operations
            known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer
            system
            may refer
            to a <em>nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral
                equipment</em> needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and
            function
            together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

        <h3>Computer Basics</h3>

        <p>The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be
            numerically encoded, people soon realized that computers are capable of general-purpose information
            processing.
            Their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and accuracy of weather forecasting.
            Their
            speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to
            control
            mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear reactors, and robotic surgical tools. They are also cheap
            enough
            to be embedded in everyday appliances and to make clothes dryers and rice cookers “smart.” Computers have
            allowed us to pose and answer questions that could not be pursued before. These questions might be about DNA
            sequences in genes, patterns of activity in a consumer market, or all the uses of a word in texts that have
            been
            stored in a database. Increasingly, computers can also learn and adapt as they operate.</p>
