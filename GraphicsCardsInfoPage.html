    <h1>Graphics cards info</h1>
    <p>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is an electronic circuit that can perform mathematical calculations at high
        speed.
        Computing tasks like graphics rendering, machine learning (ML), and video editing require the application of
        similar
        mathematical operations on a large dataset.</p>

    <h3>Radeon Graphics Cards</h3>

    <p>Radeon is a brand of computer products, including graphics processing units, random-access memory,
        RAM disk software, and solid-state drives, produced by Radeon Technologies Group, a division of AMD.[1] The
        brand was launched in 2000 by ATI Technologies, which was acquired by AMD in 2006 for US$5.4 billion. Radeon
        Graphics is the successor to the Rage line. Three different families of microarchitectures can be roughly
        distinguished, the fixed-pipeline family, the unified shader model-families of TeraScale and Graphics Core Next.
        ATI/AMD have developed different technologies, such as TruForm, HyperMemory, HyperZ, XGP, Eyefinity for
        multi-monitor setups, PowerPlay for power-saving, CrossFire (for multi-GPU) or Hybrid Graphics. A range of SIP
        blocks is also to be found on certain models in the Radeon products line: Unified Video Decoder, Video Coding
        Engine and TrueAudio.

        The brand was previously only known as "ATI Radeon" until August 2010, when it was renamed to increase AMD's
        brand awareness on a global scale.[2] Products up to and including the HD 5000 series are branded as ATI Radeon,
        while the HD 6000 series and beyond use the new AMD Radeon branding.[3]

        On 11 September 2015, AMD's GPU business was split into a separate unit known as Radeon Technologies Group, with
        Raja Koduri as Senior Vice President and chief architect.[1][4]</p>

    <h3>Nvidia Graphics Cards</h3>

    <p>View this page on Wikipedia. GeForce is a brand of graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia. As of the
        GeForce 20 series, there have been fifteen iterations of the design. February 28, 2006

        With respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia's GeForce and AMD's Radeon GPUs are the
        only remaining competitors in the high-end market. Along with its nearest competitor, the AMD Radeon, the
        GeForce architecture is moving toward general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU). GPGPU is expected to
        expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a high-performance
        computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different
        strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for
        complex decision-making code).</p>
