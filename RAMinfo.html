    <h1>RAM info</h1>
    <p>RAM (random access memory) is a computer's short-term memory, where the data that the processor is currently
        using is stored. Your computer can access RAM memory much faster than data on a hard disk, SSD, or other
        long-term storage device, which is why RAM capacity is critical for system performance</p>
