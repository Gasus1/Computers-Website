    <h1 class="alignCenter">RAM</h1>
    <p class="alignCenter">RAM (random access memory) is a computer's short-term memory, where the data that the
        processor is currently
        using is stored. Your computer can access RAM memory much faster than data on a hard disk, SSD, or other
        long-term storage device, which is why RAM capacity is critical for system performance</p>

    <h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
    <p>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read
        and changed in any
        order, typically used to store working data and machine code.[1][2] A random-access memory device allows data
        items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data
        inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs
        and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the time required to read and write data items varies
        significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such
        as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

        RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for
        reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM
        devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.</p>

    <h3>Types of RAM</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>FPM DRAM.</li>
        <li>SDR RAM.</li>
        <li>RD RAM.</li>
        <li>VRAM.</li>
        <li>EDO RAM.</li>
        <li>Flash Memory.</li>
        <li>DDR RAM.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>DDR RAM</h3>

    <p>DDR is the type of RAM that is used most commonly in PCs.</p>
    <p>The full form of DDR SDRAM is Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory. It is just like SDRAM.
        The only difference between the two is that it has a higher bandwidth, which offers greater speed. Its maximum
        transfer rate to L2 cache which is approximately 1,064 Mbps.</p>

    <h3>Uses of RAM</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>RAM is utilized in the computer as a scratchpad, buffer, and main memory.</li>
        <li>It offers a fast operating speed.</li>
        <li>It is also popular for its compatibility.</li>
        <li>It offers low power dissipation.</li>
    </ul>
