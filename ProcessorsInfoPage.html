    <h1>Processors info</h1>
    <p>Processors tell everything from your graphics processing unit (GPU) to your disk drives and screens what to do.
        Intel and AMD are some of the most common manufacturers, and they each have different series of processors. In
        general, the higher the number in the series, the more power you'll have for processing tasks.</p>
