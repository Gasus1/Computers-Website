    <h1>Processors info</h1>
    <p>Processors tell everything from your graphics processing unit (GPU) to your disk drives and screens what to do.
        Intel and AMD are some of the most common manufacturers, and they each have different series of processors. In
        general, the higher the number in the series, the more power you'll have for processing tasks.</p>

    <h3>AMD</h3>

    <p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational corporation and semiconductor company based in
        Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer
        markets.

        AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors, graphics processors, and
        FPGAs for servers, workstations, personal computers, and embedded system applications. The company has also
        expanded into new markets, such as the data center, gaming, and high-performance computing[2] markets. AMD's
        processors are used in a wide range of computing devices, including personal computers, servers, laptops, and
        gaming consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its
        manufacturing, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009.

    <h3>Intel</h3>

    <p>Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara,
        California, and incorporated in Delaware.[3] Intel is one of the world's largest semiconductor chip
        manufacturers by revenue[4][5] and ranked in the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by
        revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal years, until it was removed from the ranking in 2018.[6]
        In 2020, it was reinstated and ranked 45th, being the 7th-largest technology company in the ranking.

        Intel supplies microprocessors for most manufacturers of computer systems, and is one of the developers of the
        x86 series of instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). It also manufactures chipsets, network
        interface controllers, flash memory, graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs),
        and other devices related to communications and computing. Intel has a strong presence in the high-performance
        general-purpose and gaming PC market with its Intel Core line of CPUs, whose high-end models are among the
        fastest consumer CPUs, as well as its Intel Arc series of GPUs, and sponsors the Intel Extreme Masters, a series
        of international esports tournaments. The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP,
        and supports other open source projects such as Wayland, Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.[7]</p>
